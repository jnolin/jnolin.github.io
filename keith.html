  <p>This is the most recent video uploaded to the KEITHDICKLE67 youtube channel. As you progress down you can see the major improvements from the first few videos to now. I have learned many different tricks of how to make editing text easier, and it is currently on of my favorite effects, simply because of all the things you can do with it. The constant improvements along with the support from friends has allowed me to continue making videos.</p>

  <p>The video here in the most popular video currently on the channel. It's not to crazy but it did take a while to make, and was my longest non-montage video for a while. I experamented with the speed of the video, slo-mo, sound effects, and text on the screen. I have tried to keep up with the "narration" so when you can't hear it that well you can still understand whats happening.</p>

  <p>The video to the left is the first video I ever made about Rainbow Six Seige. It is what started the channel and made me inspired to keep improving the videos. When I started I really had no plan or thought as to what I should do, but I finally setteled on a montage just to show off some fun clips. The hardest part was finding chill music. Looking back now it was a weird choice but I still enjoy it none the less.</p>
