<section class="aboutMe">
<p>Hello My name is Jasper Nolin, I am in Computer Animation at CTE, and I currently attend Essex High School. This is my second year in CAWD (Computer Animation & Web Design). I also have taken 4 years of movie/videography classes and another semester of photography. I am able to use many of the adobe softwares as well as blender, atom, codepen, and filmora wondershare. I do a lot of work in Blender, which is a 3D modeling software. In my first year of CAWD we did a lot of work inside Blender and worked on moving some of those assets into unity and unreal engine, to try and make little platform games. In CAWD 2 we are working on building assets for another game and for a competition called SkillsUSA. SkillsUSA is a competition for designers of all categories. If we win we could get scholarships, money, and grants. I also do a lot of editing for youtube videos, down below is a link to the channel if you want to check it out. </p>
